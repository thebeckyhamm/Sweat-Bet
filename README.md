###The Backstory

This is my final project for The Iron Yard St. Pete. I needed a) some 
accountability, and b) more motivation to meet my health goals.  Other fitness 
apps weren't cutting it because there was no one checking up on my progress.

So I decided to combine something that really motivates me - fantasy football - 
with tracking health goals, so SweatBet was born.
